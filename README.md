🚘 Ford Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be used to predict the price of Ford cars based on various features such as year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, etc.
The project is built purely for learning and practice purposes in Machine Learning.

📌 Project Overview

Car price prediction is a common real-world Machine Learning problem.
In this project, we focus on Ford cars and apply Linear Regression to understand how different factors influence the car price.

Objective:
To build a regression model that predicts car prices with reasonable accuracy using historical data.
